                            Maximising Energy Efficiency for Lower Emissions
                        </p>
                        <p className='mb-2'>
                            Effective energy management is crucial for reducing emissions. To address this, we have implemented several sustainable practices, including using solar panels and biofuels to generate electricity. These efforts have significantly lowered our carbon footprint, producing around 27.5 million kilowatt-hours of renewable energy, which accounts for 43% of our India’s operations
                        </p>
                        <p className='mb-2'>
                            We continually strive to optimise our operations through various initiatives. These include enhancing equipment efficiency by upgrading steam dryers, air compressors and motors to higher energy-saving standards. We are also focused
                            on minimising energy loss by reducing compressed air pressure, optimising compressor cycles and improving power transmission
                            and distribution. Additionally, we are adopting sustainable practices such as using battery forklifts and energy-efficient switchgear. We aim to substantially increase the share of renewable energy in our operations in India from 43% to 56% .

                    Our commitment to sustainability extends to the packaging of our products. For both new and existing products, we are transitioning to recyclable packaging in phases.

                    We are making progress towards our ambitious plastic management goals, guided by the following framework of 3R’s which stands for Reduce, Reuse and Recycle.

                <p className='mb-3'>
                    We are in continuously trying to reduce the impact of packaging on the environment. This is being achieved by reducing consumption of plastic in packaging. By using innovative structures and polymer recipes, we have successfully
                    been able to down gauge our packaging specifications and hence reducing plastic production. In this way we not only reduce carbon emission at the time of packaging production but by dispatching less of plastic, we are decreasing logistic carbon footprint.

                    Resource optimisation, responsible consumption and waste minimisation are deeply rooted in our goals. We are working towards increasing consumer awareness to reuse the bigger packs by communicating it at the back panel of our packaging.

                            With concentrated efforts, we are working towards increasing recyclability of our packaging. We are in the process of sustainable pack innovation to reduce carbon footprint while simultaneously ensuring quality and safety of products. We are working hard
                            to make progress in our business but we cannot turn the tide on plastic pollution alone. Thus, we are working with other recycling agencies and seeking optimal extended producer-responsibility legislation in which we pay for packaging collection and recycling of plastic packaging. We are already using recycled paper in our secondary packaging. In primary packaging range for domestic business, woven-propylene bags are 90% homogenous and recycle ready. Successful work has been done towards making multi-layer laminate packaging recycle ready.

                            in the process of conducting vendor awareness programmes, with the intent of making them
                            a part of our sustainable journey and we have started educating them about our approach for a better planet.  During audit vendor audits, special emphasis has been given on environmental and social practices. This has been made a part of formal process. As a Company goal, we intend to move towards a sustainable packaging procurement policy through this journey
