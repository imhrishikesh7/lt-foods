                Our materiality assessment
                spans a comprehensive range
                of ESG topics crucial to our operations. This process begins
                by identifying sustainability issues that are pertinent to our business operations. Our robust and efficient cross-functional internal team, then, prioritises the material topics while keeping the best interests of the stakeholders at the heart of our decision-making. This foundational step has been essential in shaping our corporate strategy, guiding
                our business practices and accelerating our progress.
                <br /><br />
                We ensure that insights from industry best practices and feedback from our stakeholders are incorporated into this interactive and data-driven process. This
                helps in building a balanced
                and comprehensive approach, addressing the relevant areas across our value chain. The critical issues for stakeholders, identified through this process, guide our decision- making process and shape our
                ESG goals as well.
