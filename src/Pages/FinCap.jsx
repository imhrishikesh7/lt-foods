                    As we navigate the challenging market conditions with fluctuating input prices and shifting consumer behaviours, we focus on strategic investments, brand penetration, consumer aquisition and operational excellence allowing
                    us to not only withstand these challenges but also drive growth.
                    <br /><br />
                    We are steadfast in our strategy
                    to balance the reinvestment of earnings to fuel sustained growth while ensuring a rewarding return to our shareholders through dividends. The free cash flow generated from our thriving Basmati and Specialty Rice segments, along with our expanding Organic and RTE/RTH and RTC platforms, are strategically reinvested to drive our core business and invest in new engines of growth. This deliberate approach strengthens our brand’s foundation, enhancing market presence and operational efficiency and setting us on a path to achieve our long-term financial targets
                    of strong financial matrices i.e. improved return on invested capital and return on equity.

                <b className='text-[#f47921]'>Robust Financial Performance</b>
                <p>
                    In terms of financial health, our operational cash flows have seen
                    a substantial boost, enabling us to significantly reduce our dependency on working capital loans from
                    ₹ 676.86 Crore to ₹ 515.62 Crore. Our financial prudence has led to a marked improvement in our debt-to-EBITDA ratio from 0.95 to 0.53.
                    <br /><br />
                    On the other hand, our Return on Capital Employed (ROCE) increased from 13.6% four years ago to 21.7% this year, telling a story of not just recovery but robust expansion. Similarly, our Return on Equity (ROE) has shown significant improvement, reflecting our ability to generate wealth efficiently from shareholder equity.
                    <br /><br />
                    We have also made continuous improvements in our operational KPIs. Our EBITDA margin, standing at 12.63% , has benefited from strategic investments on Brand and premiumisation. With a focused  thrust towards premiumisation, supported by a higher scale of operations and product portfolio diversification, we anticipate further margin expansion.
                    <br /><br />
                    Our working capital management has also seen notable progress, with working capital days reduced from 193 days in previous year to 189
                    days currently. These improvements highlight our refined inventory management and more favourable credit terms from vendors.
                    <br /><br />
                    In our commitment to rewarding
                    our shareholders, we have revised our dividend policy from 10-20%
                    of standalone profits to 10-20%
                    of consolidated profits, aligning shareholder rewards with our broader business performance.
                    <br /><br />
                    Our financial performance remains strong, with significant increases in revenue, EBITDA and PAT, highlighting the effectiveness
                    of our strategic initiatives and operational optimisations.

                    Our approach to capital allocation is deeply rooted in strengthening our core operations. We are channeling resources into product innovation, brand enhancement and market expansion. By focusing on high- demand segments, particularly premium products, we are driving growth through health-focused innovations and consumer-centric initiatives. Our efforts to expand our distribution network and leverage data-driven insights are designed to maximise market penetration and operational efficiency, fortifying our market position and paving the way for sustained financial growth.

                <p className='mb-4 mt-1'>
                    Recognising key market trends— such as the youthful demographic in India, the growing Indian diaspora abroad and the global popularity of Indian cuisine—we are strategically diversifying our product offerings. This involves both organic growth initiatives and strategic acquisitions. By launching new products and reallocating resources to high-potential markets, we are positioning LT Foods to capture new consumer segments and ensure long-term sustainable returns.

                <b>Entering New Geographies and Widening Distribution Channels</b>
                <p className='mb-4 mt-1'>
                    Our investment strategy includes judicious capital deployment to support our global expansion. We are entering new geographies and expanding our distribution channels through strategic partnerships
                    and localised product offerings. By investing in market analysis and forming alliances with local distributors, we are enhancing our market entry strategies. Additionally, our commitment to building a strong presence on e-commerce and digital platforms ensures that our products are readily available, meeting the diverse needs of consumers across the globe.

                <b>Exploring Inorganic Opportunities </b>
                <p className='mb-4 mt-1'>
                    To accelerate our growth and enhance shareholder value, LT Foods is actively pursuing strategic Mergers And Acquisitions (M&A). Our M&A strategy is focused on acquiring businesses wherein we can leverage our strong brand equity of DAAWAT®  and Royal®, our global distribution network and the back-end infrastructure. These targeted acquisitions enable us to expand our geographic footprint, improve our competitive advantage and deliver increased value
                    to our stakeholders.

                    Achieving economies of scale
                    is a key aspect of our strategy
                    to enhance profitability. By increasing production capacity
                    and distributing fixed costs over
                    a larger output, we lower per-unit costs and improve operational efficiency. Additionally, we
                    are unlocking synergies from
                    our acquisitions, streamlining operations and optimising resource utilisation, reducing costs and improving financial performance.

                    Across the Value Chain </b>
                <p className='mb-4 mt-1'>
                    We are focusing on enhancing efficiency across our entire value chain to drive margin expansion. By implementing advanced technologies, automating processes and adopting best practices in supply chain management, we have been able to reduce waste, lower operational costs and speed up time-to- market. These enhancements
                    not only enhance cost savings
                    but also improve the agility and responsiveness of our operations, leading to higher profit margins.

                <b>Driving Premiumisation </b>
                <p className='mb-4 mt-1'>
                    Our focus on premiumisation
                    is central to our strategy for driving profitability. We are directing resources towards the development and marketing
                    of premium products. Through continuous innovation, superior quality and targeted marketing, we are elevating our brand’s market position and capturing
                    a larger share of the high-value segment. This approach enables us to command higher price points, enhancing our revenue as well as expand our profit margins.
