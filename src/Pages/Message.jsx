                <p className='my-2'>
                    Basmati, renowned for its fragrant aroma, long grains and fluffy texture, has always been an aspirational product. Driven by growing consumption and evolving trends, our basmati category has recorded robust growth over the years.
                    <br /><br />
                    The basmati market in India is growing at a healthy CAGR of 7-8% over the past decade. Despite this growth, basmati is still only c4% of the total rice consumed in India, up from about 2.5%
                    a decade ago.  This growth can be attributed to a
                    variety of factors, especially
                    a rise in per capita income, resulting in more Basmati consumption. This has also steadily increased basmati consumption among current non-basmati consuming homes.
                    <br /><br />
                    In addition to this, the industry is observing a paradigm shift towards packaged and branded offering from loose and unbranded basmati packets. It is further anticipated
                    that with the Government encouraging consumer- oriented approach and food safety-oriented policies such as GST Rate Equalisation, FSSAI notification on Basmati Standards, it will further encourage consumers to avail consistent value offered by the established brands.
