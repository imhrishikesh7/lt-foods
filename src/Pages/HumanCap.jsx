                    In the last few years, LT Foods has been on a pivotal human resources transformation journey, charting the course to redefine and elevate our HR landscape to meet the dynamic needs of a growing global organisation. This journey, aligned with our vision, aims to cultivate a high- performance culture and ensures a consistent employee experience, transcending geographical and functional boundaries.

                        <p className='my-2'>
                            The transformational journey began with a thorough review
                            of our organisational structure, people processes and practices as well as work culture. By redefining roles and responsibilities at all levels, we enhanced clarity and alignment within our teams, driving a high-performance culture, riving us closer to our strategic vision. This reorganisation was carefully planned and executed, with a focus on defining distinct roles including individual Key Result Areas (KRAs) and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), essential for high performance,  operational efficiency and sustainable growth. Extensive communication  at both group and individual level, ensured that every employee understood their specific role, providing a clear path for career progression.
